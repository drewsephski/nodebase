# Drag-and-Drop Workflow Automation Platform

A modern **workflow automation platform** for building, executing, and monitoring automated processes through a visual, node-based interface. Designed to eliminate repetitive work, reduce integration complexity, and save hours by turning scattered scripts and manual processes into reliable, observable workflows.

Built as an **open-source-first foundation** with a clear path to production and commercialization.

## ⚡ Why It Exists

* Replace manual workflows and brittle glue code
* Centralize API integrations and business logic
* Make automation understandable, debuggable, and reusable
* Reduce engineering time spent on non-core tasks

## 🚀 Core Capabilities

* **Visual Workflow Builder** – Drag-and-drop automation design
* **Execution Engine** – Asynchronous, fault-aware workflow runs
* **Real-Time Observability** – Live status, logs, and failure insight
* **Type-Safe by Default** – End-to-end TypeScript guarantees
* **Secure by Design** – Authenticated, user-scoped workflows
* **Extensible Architecture** – Built to support custom nodes and integrations

## 🧠 Technology Stack

* **Next.js 15 + React 19** – Modern App Router and Server Components
* **TypeScript** – Shared types across frontend, API, and database
* **tRPC + React Query** – Fully type-safe APIs with intelligent caching
* **PostgreSQL + Prisma** – Reliable, scalable data layer
* **Better Auth** – Secure authentication and session handling
* **TailwindCSS + Radix UI** – Accessible, consistent, production-grade UI

## 🏗️ Architectural Principles

* API-first with zero type duplication
* Clear separation between UI, orchestration, and execution
* Workflow graphs stored as flexible, versionable data models
* Designed to scale from simple automations to complex systems

## 🧩 Workflow Engine

* Node-based automation model
* API, webhook, and data integrations
* Structured execution logging and status tracking
* Built for reliability, extensibility, and iteration speed

## 🏎️ Performance & Developer Experience

* Reduced client bundle via Server Components
* Minimal redundant data fetching through smart caching
* Predictable database access with Prisma
* Clean, maintainable codebase optimized for long-term evolution

## 🎯 Project Direction

* **Open-source-first** with strong architectural discipline
* Built as a real product, not a demo or toy clone
* Designed to evolve into a commercial-grade automation platform
* Focused on saving time, reducing operational friction, and scaling automation

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome. This project serves both as a production-ready automation platform and a reference implementation for modern full-stack systems design.
